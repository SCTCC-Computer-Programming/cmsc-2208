## Week 1 focus

This week is about building the starting point for the semester. Chapter 1 introduces the language and workflow used throughout the book. Your focus is to understand what machine learning means in this course, what problems it is used for, and how the textbook organizes the steps from data to a trained model.

Chapter 1 of Introduction to Machine Learning with Python sets the foundation for the rest of the book by introducing the core vocabulary and framing used throughout. It explains what machine learning is used for, outlines the kinds of tasks the book focuses on, and emphasizes the importance of understanding your problem and your data before choosing a model. The chapter also introduces the main tools used in the course (especially scikit-learn and the supporting Python ecosystem) and shows a complete first example so you can see what an end-to-end machine learning task looks like in practice.

## How this course approaches machine learning

This course approaches machine learning as a programming workflow carried out in Python. Chapter 1 reflects that approach by introducing machine learning through concrete tasks and examples, using the Python tool ecosystem and scikit-learn’s model interface. In Chapter 1, the authors focus on:

* framing a real-world question as a machine learning task,
* representing the problem with a dataset (features and targets),
* training a model using scikit-learn,
* and checking performance using held-out test data.

In this course, you will primarily be asked to implement and evaluate models using existing tools, interpret what the results mean, and explain your choices using correct terminology. While mathematical ideas may appear as needed to support interpretation, the course emphasis is on building practical skill with the workflow and developing good habits for working with models and data.


## What machine learning means in this book

Chapter 1 introduces machine learning as extracting knowledge from data, and it motivates machine learning by contrasting it with systems built from hand-coded decision rules. The chapter uses examples such as spam filtering and face detection to show why rule-based approaches can break down, and how learning from data can be a practical alternative.

Two ideas are introduced early:

* Machine learning methods automate decision-making by generalizing from known examples, rather than relying on a fixed set of hand-built rules.
* The quality of what a model can learn depends on what information is actually present in the dataset, especially in the features used to describe each example. 

For that reason, Chapter 1 spends time defining how data is described in machine learning. It introduces the “table” framing (samples as rows and features as columns), names the key terms sample and feature, and emphasizes that no algorithm can make predictions using information that is not represented in the features.


## Supervised vs unsupervised learning

Chapter 1 distinguishes two broad categories of machine learning problems:

* supervised learning, where you have input data along with a known outcome you want to predict
* unsupervised learning, where you have input data but no known outcomes provided to the algorithm

The chapter gives concrete examples of both kinds of tasks, and it emphasizes that supervised learning requires building a dataset that includes the desired outcome.

Chapter 1 then walks through a supervised learning example: predicting iris species from flower measurements. This example is used to introduce the vocabulary you will see repeatedly:

* samples (rows/data points) and features (columns/properties)
* targets/labels (the known outcomes in supervised learning)
* training data versus test data (evaluating on data not used to fit the model)

You do not need to memorize every detail yet. The goal is to recognize what makes a problem supervised, and to understand why the book spends time on data representation and evaluation before expanding into more algorithms in later chapters.

Note: the formal “classification vs regression” distinction is introduced in Chapter 2, even though Chapter 1’s iris walkthrough is a classification example.


## Datasets, features, and targets

Chapter 1 introduces the vocabulary the book uses to describe data in machine learning.

* A dataset is a collection of examples (also called samples or data points).
* Each example is described by features, which are measurable properties used as inputs to a model.
* In supervised learning, each example also has a target value (often called a label). In classification problems, the possible target values are sometimes called classes.

Chapter 1 also describes datasets in a “table” form: samples are organized as rows and features as columns.

The book uses the notation X for the input data (the features) and y for the target values. You will see X and y throughout the text and in scikit-learn examples.

This week, focus on recognizing what X and y represent conceptually rather than worrying about exact shapes or implementation details.

## Training data and test data

Chapter 1 introduces the distinction between training data and test data as part of its first complete machine learning example.

The chapter explains that:

* a model is fit using one portion of the available data (the training set),
* and performance is evaluated using a separate portion of the data that was not used during training (the test set).

This separation allows you to check how well a model performs on new, unseen data, rather than just how well it fits the data it was trained on. Chapter 1 emphasizes that evaluating a model on the same data used for training can give an overly optimistic view of its performance.

You should understand why this separation is necessary, even though the mechanics of splitting data and evaluating models will be explored in more detail in later chapters.

## A first end-to-end example

Chapter 1 includes a complete, small-scale machine learning example using the iris flower dataset. The purpose of this example is not to teach you every detail, but to show what an end-to-end machine learning task looks like in practice and to introduce the workflow the book will return to throughout the course.

As you read this example, focus on the sequence of steps:

1. load a dataset,
2. separate features and targets,
3. inspect the data (for example, with simple visualizations),
4. split the data into training and test sets,
5. train a model on the training data,
6. evaluate the model on the test data.

Do not worry if some parts feel unfamiliar at first. The goal in Week 1 is to recognize what each step is doing and why it appears in the workflow.


## Tools introduced in Chapter 1

Chapter 1 introduces the main Python libraries used throughout the book:

| Tool | Role in the book |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| NumPy | Provides efficient numerical arrays and supports many operations used by other libraries |
| pandas | Used for working with structured, tabular data |
| matplotlib | Used for basic visualization and inspecting data |
| scikit-learn | Provides machine learning algorithms and workflows |

You are not expected to master these tools in Week 1. You are expected to recognize their names and understand why each one exists.

## Reading expectations and habits

Chapter 1 is short but dense. You should read it slowly and actively.

When you encounter unfamiliar terms:

-   pause and reread the surrounding paragraph,
-   connect the term to the example being shown,
-   avoid memorizing definitions in isolation.

The goal is to build conceptual familiarity, not technical mastery.

If you compare your output to the book’s examples later, remember that small differences in formatting or values are normal. Focus on whether the ideas and results make sense, not whether they look identical.

## Week 1 tasks

This week, you should:

1.  Read Chapter 1 of the textbook carefully.
2.  Follow the course setup instructions and complete the Week 1 verification assignment.
3.  Complete the D2L quiz for Chapter 1.
4.  Reflect on how machine learning problems are structured in the book.

## Knowledge goals for Week 1

By the end of this week, you should be able to explain:

-   What the book means by *machine learning*
-   The difference between classification and regression
-   What a dataset, feature, and target are
-   Why data is split into training and test sets
-   What the basic machine learning workflow looks like
-   Why data representation matters before algorithm choice
