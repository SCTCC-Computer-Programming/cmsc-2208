NewQuestion,M,
QuestionText,"Match the regularization parameter with its correct behavior.",
Choice,1,"alpha (in Ridge/Lasso)",
Match,1,"Regularization strength; larger values = more regularization",
Choice,2,"C (in LogisticRegression/LinearSVC)",
Match,2,"Inverse regularization strength; larger values = less regularization",
Choice,3,"Large alpha value",
Match,3,"Produces simpler model with smaller coefficients",
Choice,4,"Large C value",
Match,4,"Produces more complex model that fits training data closely",

NewQuestion,M,
QuestionText,"Match the regularization type with its characteristic effect on coefficients.",
Choice,1,"L1 regularization (Lasso)",
Match,1,"Can set coefficients exactly to zero (sparse models)",
Choice,2,"L2 regularization (Ridge)",
Match,2,"Shrinks coefficients toward zero but keeps them nonzero",
Choice,3,"ElasticNet",
Match,3,"Combines both L1 and L2 penalties",
Choice,4,"No regularization",
Match,4,"Coefficients unconstrained; risk of overfitting",
