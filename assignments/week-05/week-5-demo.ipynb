        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "So far in this course, we've explored three different approaches to supervised learning:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Week 2 - k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN):**\n",
        "- **Stores** all training data and searches through it at prediction time\n",
        "- Makes predictions by finding similar examples and voting (or averaging)\n",
        "- Controlled by k: how many neighbors to consider\n",
        "\n",
        "**Week 3 - Linear Models (Ridge Regression, Logistic Regression):**\n",
        "- **Learns a formula** during training: a weighted combination of features\n",
        "- Makes predictions by plugging values into the formula\n",
        "- Controlled by alpha or C: how much regularization to apply\n",
        "\n",
        "**This Week - Decision Trees:**\n",
        "- **Learns a hierarchy of questions** during training (a tree structure)\n",
        "- Makes predictions by asking those questions in order and following branches\n",
        "- Controlled by max_depth: how many questions can be asked in sequence\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Are Decision Trees?\n",
        "\n",
        "Decision trees work like the game 20 Questions. When trying to identify something (an animal, object, or person), you ask yes/no questions where each answer leads to another question, until you reach a final decision:\n",
        "\n",
        "- \"Does it have feathers?\" → Yes → \"Can it fly?\" → No → Penguin!\n",
        "- \"Does it have feathers?\" → No → \"Does it live in water?\" → Yes → Dolphin!\n",
        "\n",
        "A decision tree follows this same pattern. It asks a series of questions about the features, and each answer leads to another question, until finally reaching a prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key characteristics:**\n",
        "- The model is a **tree structure** with questions at each node\n",
        "- Each question splits the data based on one feature\n",
        "- The tree keeps asking questions until it reaches a **leaf** (final decision)\n",
        "- During training, the algorithm figures out **which questions to ask** and **in what order**\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Makes Decision Trees Different?\n",
        "\n",
        "| Aspect | kNN | Linear Models | Decision Trees |\n",
        "|--------|-----|---------------|----------------|\n",
        "| What it learns | Nothing (stores data) | A formula with weights | A hierarchy of questions |\n",
        "| Training process | Just stores data | Finds optimal weights | Builds tree by asking questions |\n",
        "| How it predicts | Searches for neighbors | Applies formula | Follows tree branches |\n",
        "| Interpretability | Hard to explain why | Can see feature weights | Can visualize decision path |\n",
        "| Data requirements | Needs scaling | Needs scaling | **No scaling needed!** |\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the biggest advantages of decision trees: **you don't need to scale or normalize your data**. Since each question only looks at one feature at a time (\"Is attendance > 80%?\"), the scale of other features doesn't matter.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What This Demo Covers\n",
        "\n",
        "This demo covers:\n",

        "- Comparing decision trees to the other algorithms we've learned\n",
        "- Knowing when to use decision trees vs other approaches\n",

        "- How to visualize the actual tree structure (with graphviz)\n",
        "- More parameters for controlling tree complexity\n",
        "- Why trees can overfit on complex data\n",
        "- **Ensemble methods** (Random Forests and Gradient Boosting) that combine many trees to make even more powerful models\n",
        "\n",
        "## Part 1: Creating the Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "This section continues using the student performance dataset from previous weeks. Using the same dataset helps focus on understanding the new algorithm without having to learn a new domain.\n",
        "\n",

        "1. Decision trees learn a hierarchy of if/else questions during training, then follow that path to make predictions\n",
        "2. The `max_depth` parameter controls tree complexity: deeper trees can ask more questions\n",
        "3. Feature importance shows which features the tree used most for making decisions\n",
        "4. Trees don't require feature scaling, unlike kNN and linear models\n",
        "5. On clean synthetic data, trees may not show obvious overfitting; real-world messy data often does\n",
        "6. Trees are easy to interpret but can overfit on complex data without proper depth limits\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Challenge with Single Decision Trees\n",
        "\n",
        "Single decision trees have one major weakness: **they tend to overfit on complex data**. When you have noisy, real-world data, trees often memorize training examples rather than learning general patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "On this clean synthetic student data, overfitting isn't a major problem. But on datasets like:\n",
        "- Medical diagnosis (lots of noise and uncertainty)\n",
        "- Customer behavior (many random factors)\n",
        "- Image classification (high-dimensional, complex patterns)\n",
        "\n",
        "...single trees often struggle.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Enter Ensembles: The Solution\n",
        "\n",
        "The textbook introduces two powerful ensemble methods that fix this problem by **combining many trees**:\n",

        "**Random Forests:**\n",
        "- Builds hundreds of trees, each slightly different\n",
        "- Each tree sees a random subset of the data and features\n",
        "- Averages their predictions\n",
        "- Result: Much more robust, less overfitting\n",
        "\n",
        "**Gradient Boosting:**\n",
        "- Builds trees one at a time\n",
        "- Each new tree focuses on correcting the previous tree's mistakes\n",
        "- Result: Often the best performance, but requires careful tuning\n",
        "\n",
        "These ensemble methods keep all the benefits of trees (no scaling, interpretable, handles mixed features) while dramatically reducing overfitting.\n",
