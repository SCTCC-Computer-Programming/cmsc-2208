        "# Week 7 Demo: Uncertainty Estimates from Classifiers\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "So far in this course, every time we've used a classifier, we've asked one question: **what does the model predict?** We call `.predict()` and get back a label (\"pass\" or \"fail,\" \"stay\" or \"churn\"). We call `.score()` and get back a single accuracy number that tells us how often those predictions are correct.\n",
        "\n",
        "But `.predict()` only gives us the model's final answer. It doesn't tell us how confident the model is in that answer. Consider two students who are both predicted to fail:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Student A:** The model is 95% sure this student will fail\n",
        "- **Student B:** The model is 52% sure this student will fail\n",
        "\n",
        "`.predict()` returns \"fail\" for both students, but these are very different situations. Student A shows clear signs of struggling, while Student B is essentially a coin flip. If you were an academic advisor deciding who to contact for extra support, you'd probably treat these two students very differently, and you'd want to know which situation you're dealing with.\n",
        "\n",
        "This week, we learn how to ask classifiers a richer question: **how confident are you in each prediction?** Scikit-learn provides two methods for this:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`predict_proba`** returns probability estimates (values between 0 and 1 that are easy to interpret)\n",
        "- **`decision_function`** returns raw confidence scores (values on an arbitrary scale that are harder to interpret)\n",
        "\n",
        "Both go beyond the simple yes/no answer of `.predict()` and reveal the model's level of certainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What This Demo Covers\n",
        "\n",
        "This demo covers:\n",
        "- Using `predict_proba` to get probability estimates for each class\n",
        "- Interpreting what the probability columns mean and how they relate to `.predict()`\n",
        "- Using `decision_function` to get raw confidence scores\n",
        "- Understanding the difference between `predict_proba` and `decision_function`\n",
        "- Why prediction confidence matters for real-world decisions\n",
        "\n",
        "The textbook then shows you:\n",
        "- These methods applied to GradientBoostingClassifier with 2D visualizations\n",
        "- How uncertainty estimates extend to multiclass problems (more than two classes)\n",
        "- The concept of model calibration (when reported probabilities match actual outcomes)\n",
        "- A complete summary of all supervised learning algorithms from Chapter 2\n",

        "`predict_proba` is a method available on most scikit-learn classifiers (including LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, and KNeighborsClassifier) that returns a **probability for each class** instead of a single label. For our binary pass/fail problem, that means each student gets two numbers: the probability the model assigns to \"fail\" and the probability it assigns to \"pass.\"\n",

        "### What the Output Looks Like\n",
        "\n",
        "When you call `predict_proba`, you get back an array with **one row per student and one column per class**. For our test set of 75 students with 2 classes, the output is a 75×2 array. The column order matches the `classes_` attribute of the trained model. In our case, column 0 is P(fail) and column 1 is P(pass).\n",
        "\n",
        "Each row sums to 1.0, because the model distributes 100% of its belief across the possible classes. If the model is 90% sure a student will pass, there's only 10% left for fail.\n",

        "\n",
        "Behind the scenes, `.predict()` is actually using `predict_proba`. It gets the probabilities, finds whichever class has the higher probability, and returns that class name. The threshold is 0.5: if P(pass) ≥ 0.5, the prediction is \"pass.\" This means `.predict()` is just the last step of a probability calculation, and `predict_proba` lets you see the full picture before that final step.\n",

        "\n",
        "Instead of returning probabilities for each class, `decision_function` returns a single raw score per student. This score is not bounded between 0 and 1. It can be any number, positive or negative.\n",
        "\n",
        "The score works like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Positive values** mean the model leans toward one class (\"pass\" in our case)\n",
        "- **Negative values** mean the model leans toward the other class (\"fail\")\n",

        "\n",
        "Scikit-learn refers to these two sides as the \"positive class\" and the \"negative class.\" The positive class is always the second entry in `classes_`, and the negative class is the first. In our model, `logreg.classes_` is `['fail', 'pass']`, so \"fail\" is the negative class and \"pass\" is the positive class. That is why positive decision_function values point toward \"pass\" and negative values point toward \"fail.\"\n",

For example, LinearSVC (a linear classifier from the textbook) only provides `decision_function`.

        "The code in this section uses a technique called **boolean indexing** to select specific elements from NumPy arrays. If you haven't seen this before, this explanation will walk you through how it works. Every operation in the code below builds on these basics.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Creating a boolean array from a comparison**\n",
        "\n",
        "When you compare a NumPy array to a value, the result is a new array of `True` and `False` values, one for each element. For example, suppose we have an array of four confidence values:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "confidences = np.array([0.955, 0.623, 0.999, 0.511])\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This produces `[True, False, True, False]`. The comparison is applied to each element individually: 0.955 > 0.9 is True, 0.623 > 0.9 is False, and so on. The result is always the same length as the original array.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Using a boolean array to select elements**\n",

        "high_conf = confidences > 0.9\n",
        "confidences[high_conf]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This returns `[0.955, 0.999]`, the two values where high_conf is True. The boolean array acts as a filter: True means \"keep this element,\" False means \"skip it.\" This works across arrays of the same length, so if you have a separate predictions array, `predictions[high_conf]` would return the predictions for those same positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Combining multiple conditions with `&`**\n",

Our very confident tier (>90%) had 95.5% accuracy, which is reasonably close to the reported confidence. Not all models are this well-behaved.

        "1. **GradientBoostingClassifier examples**\n",
        "   - The textbook demonstrates both methods on GradientBoostingClassifier with a 2D dataset\n",
        "   - The 2D examples allow visualizing decision boundaries and confidence as color maps\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Multiclass uncertainty**\n",
        "   - In our demo, we used binary classification (two classes)\n",
        "   - The textbook shows how `predict_proba` and `decision_function` extend to three or more classes\n",
        "   - With multiple classes, `predict_proba` returns one column per class and `decision_function` returns one score per class\n",
        "   - The `classes_` attribute maps column indices to actual class names\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Calibration**\n",
        "   - Our confidence tier analysis in Part 5 was an informal version of checking calibration. The textbook discusses this concept in more depth, including how different models vary in how well-calibrated they are\n",

        "   - The textbook closes Chapter 2 with a summary comparing all supervised learning algorithms\n",
