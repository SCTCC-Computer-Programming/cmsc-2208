**Submission location:** **All items are submitted in D2L** (Week 1 dropboxes).
**Reading:** Chapter 1.

### Part 1: Reading

Read **all of Chapter 1** of *Introduction to Machine Learning with Python* (Müller & Guido).

Pay special attention to:

-   **Essential libraries and tools** (what the course uses and why)
-   **Key terms used in the chapter**: dataset, features (**X**), target/labels (**y**), training set, test set
-   The chapter’s first workflow idea: **split data → train a model → evaluate results**

### Part 2: Jupyter Notebook Verification

#### A) Launch Jupyter Notebook  in the correct folder

From **Anaconda Prompt / Miniconda Prompt**:

1. Activate the cmsc-2208 environment

```bat
conda activate cmsc-2208
```

*If you are using a new terminal window, you must activate the environment again.*

2. Navigate to the course-work folder

```bat
cd C:\cmsc-2208\course-work
```

3. Start jupyter notebook  

```bat
jupyter notebook
```

A browser tab will open showing the contents of `C:\cmsc-2208\course-work\`.

#### B) Create a `week01` folder and a verification notebook

1.  In the Jupyter file list, create a folder named: `week01`
2.  Open the `week01` folder
3.  Create a new notebook
4.  Save the notebook as: `lastname-nb-verification.ipynb`

#### C) Run these cells (in order)

``` python
import sys
sys.executable
```
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib
import scipy
import sklearn
```
```python
# Confirm that a built-in dataset can be loaded
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
iris = load_iris()
X = iris["data"]
y = iris["target"]
X.shape, y.shape
```
```python
# Confirm that train/test splitting works (a core workflow step)
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)
X_train.shape, X_test.shape
```
### Part 3: D2L quiz

Complete the **D2L Chapter 1 quiz**.

### Part 4: Video reflection (graded)

#### Video submission instructions

Record a short video of yourself explaining your understanding of the Week 1 workflow. Focus on explaining concepts clearly and using correct terminology rather than reading text from the screen.

In your video, address:

-   What feels different from running `.py` scripts in an editor compared to running code in a notebook
-   What the **kernel** is (in the context of jupyter notebooks)
-   Why “restart the kernel” and “run all” are useful habits
-   One concept from Chapter 1 you can explain accurately

**Requirements**

-   Clear video and audio quality
-   Intro (required): Start your video by saying: “Hello, my name is [Your Name]. This is the [Assignment Name] for CMSC 2208.”
-   Name your video file: `lastname_Week01Reflection`
-   Upload your video to **Kaltura**
-   **Do not** embed the video in the Dropbox submission
-   Paste the **share link** into the D2L assignment text submission box
-   Make sure the link text includes `lastname_Week01Reflection` in the link name (this will appear if you copy the link)

### D2L submission checklist

Submit the following items to the Week 1 D2L dropboxes.

#### Video submission (link only)

-   Video filename: `lastname_Week01Reflection`
-   Submit: Paste the share link into the D2L text submission box (do not embed the video in the Dropbox)
-   Submit your `lastname-nb-verification.ipynb` file
