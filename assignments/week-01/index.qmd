**Submission location:** **All items are submitted in D2L** (Week 1 dropboxes). **Reading:** Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 (complete).

## Part 1: Reading

Read **all of Chapter 1** and **all of Chapter 2**.

Pay special attention to:

-   **Chapter 1.3** Essential Python Libraries
-   **Chapter 1.4** Installation and Setup
-   **Chapter 1.6** Navigating This Book (import conventions, how to read examples)
-   **Chapter 2.1–2.2** Interpreter + IPython/Jupyter workflow (tab completion, `?` help)

## Part 2: Setup

Submit the following screenshots (each as a separate file):

1.  **Git installed** Screenshot name: `lastname_git-version.png` Show the output of:

-   `git --version`

2.  **Course folders created** Screenshot name: `lastname_course-folders.png` Show File Explorer displaying:

-   `C:\cmsc-1217\course-work\`
-   `C:\cmsc-1217\book\`
-   `C:\cmsc-1217\data\`

3.  **Book files cloned** Screenshot name: `lastname_book-clone.png` Show either:

-   the successful `git clone` output, **or**
-   File Explorer showing: `C:\cmsc-1217\book\pydata-book\`

4.  **Conda environment exists** Screenshot name: `lastname_conda-env-list.png` Show the output of:

-   `conda info --envs`

5.  **Core packages installed** Screenshot name: `lastname_pandas-version.png` Show the output of:

-   `python -c "import pandas as pd; print(pd.__version__)"`

(We will keep a consistent pandas version for compatibility with course/book notebooks.)

## Part 3: JupyterLab practice

#### A) Launch JupyterLab in the correct folder

From Anaconda Prompt:

1.  `conda activate pydata-book`
2.  `cd C:\cmsc-1217\course-work`
3.  `jupyter lab`

#### B) Create a `Week01` folder in `cmsc-1217` and then create and run a notebook

Create: `week01-notebook-practice.ipynb` in `course-work\week01`.

Run these cells:

``` python
import sys
sys.executable
```

``` python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib
```

``` python
message = "Notebooks run Python too"
message
```

``` python
x = 10
x + 5
```

Then use JupyterLab to:

-   Restart the kernel
-   Run all cells

Finally, do:

-   **Tab completion**: type `np.random.` and use completion
-   **Help/introspection**:

``` python
np.random.standard_normal?
```

These behaviors are part of the Chapter 2 IPython/Jupyter workflow.

#### Required screenshots

6.  **JupyterLab opened in course-work** Screenshot name: `lastname_jupyterlab-course-work.png` Show the JupyterLab file browser open in `C:\cmsc-1217\course-work\week01`.

7.  **sys.executable output** Screenshot name: `lastname_sys-executable.png`

8.  **Introspection output (`?`)** Screenshot name: `lastname_ipython-help.png`

## Part 4: IPython in a terminal

Open a new Anaconda Prompt tab/window:

1.  `conda activate pydata-book`
2.  `ipython`

Run at least one small example that produces an `In [ ]` and an `Out [ ]` (for example, assign a variable and then evaluate it).

9.  **IPython running** Screenshot name: `lastname_ipython-prompt.png` Show the IPython prompt and at least one `In [ ]` / `Out [ ]` interaction.

## Part 5: D2L quiz

Complete the **D2L Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 quiz**.

## Part 6: Video reflection

### Video Submission Instructions

Record a short video of yourself explaining your understanding of the Week 1 workflow. Focus on explaining concepts clearly and using correct terminology rather than reading text from the screen.

In your video, address:

-   What feels different from running `.py` scripts in an editor
-   What the kernel is (in your own words)
-   Why “restart the kernel” and “run all” are useful habits

**Requirements**

-   Clear video and audio quality
-   Introduce yourself at the beginning (name)
-   Name your video file: `lastname_Week01Reflection`
-   Upload your video to **Kaltura**
-   **Do not** embed the video in the Dropbox submission
-   Paste the **share link** into the D2L assignment text submission box
-   Make sure the link text includes `lastname_Week01Reflection`in the link name. This will appear if you copy the link.

## D2L submission checklist

Submit the following items to the Week 1 D2L dropboxes.

### Screenshot files (upload as separate files, not a zip)

1.  `lastname_git-version.png`
2.  `lastname_course-folders.png`
3.  `lastname_book-clone.png`
4.  `lastname_conda-env-list.png`
5.  `lastname_pandas-version.png`
6.  `lastname_jupyterlab-course-work.png`
7.  `lastname_sys-executable.png`
8.  `lastname_ipython-help.png`
9.  `lastname_ipython-prompt.png`

### Video submission (link only)

-   Video filename: `lastname_Week01Reflection`
-   Submit: Paste the share link into the D2L text submission box (do not embed the video in the Dropbox).
