**Submission location:** **All items are submitted in D2L** (Week 1 dropboxes).
**Reading:** Chapter 1.

### Part 1: Reading

Read **all of Chapter 1** of *Introduction to Machine Learning with Python* (Müller & Guido).

Pay special attention to:

-   **Essential libraries and tools** (what the course uses and why)
-   **Key terms used in the chapter**: dataset, features (**X**), target/labels (**y**), training set, test set
-   The chapter’s first workflow idea: **split data → train a model → evaluate results**

### Part 2: Setup (verification screenshots)

Submit the following screenshots to verify that the required libraries are installed and can be imported successfully. Each screenshot to be submitted as a separate file:

1.  **Git installed**
    Screenshot name: `lastname_git-version.png`

    Show the output of:
    
    ```python
    git --version
    ```
2.  **Course folders created**
    Screenshot name: `lastname_course-folders.png`
    Show File Explorer displaying:
    
    ```markdown
    C:\cmsc-2208\course-work
    C:\cmsc-2208\book
    C:\cmsc-2208\data
    ```

3.  **Book files cloned**
    Screenshot name: `lastname_book-clone.png`
    Show:

    -   the successful `git clone` output

4.  **Conda environment exists**
    Screenshot name: `lastname_conda-env-list.png`
    
    Show the output of:
    ```python
    conda info --envs
    ```
5.  **Core machine learning packages installed (import verification)**
    Screenshot name: `lastname_ml-package-versions.png`
    
    Show the output of running:
    ```python
    python -c "import sys; import numpy as np; import pandas as pd; import scipy; import sklearn; import matplotlib; print('python', sys.version.split()[0]); print('numpy', np.__version__); print('pandas', pd.__version__); print('scipy', scipy.__version__); print('sklearn', sklearn.__version__); print('matplotlib', matplotlib.__version__)"
    ```

### Part 3: Jupyter Notebook Verification

#### A) Launch Jupyter Notebook  in the correct folder

From **Anaconda Prompt / Miniconda Prompt**:

1.  `conda activate cmsc-2208`
    *If you are using a new terminal window, you must activate the environment again.*

2.  `cd C:\cmsc-2208\course-work`

3.  `jupyter notebook`

A browser tab will open showing the contents of `C:\cmsc-2208\course-work\`.

#### B) Create a `week01` folder and a verification notebook

1.  In the Jupyter file list, create a folder named: `week01`
2.  Open the `week01` folder
3.  Create a new notebook
4.  Save the notebook as: `week01-notebook-verification.ipynb`

#### C) Run these cells (in order)

``` python
import sys
sys.executable
```
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib
import scipy
import sklearn
```
```python
# Confirm that a built-in dataset can be loaded
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
iris = load_iris()
X = iris["data"]
y = iris["target"]
X.shape, y.shape
```
```python
# Confirm that train/test splitting works (a core workflow step)
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)
X_train.shape, X_test.shape
```


### Part 4: D2L quiz

Complete the **D2L Chapter 1 quiz**.

### Part 5: Video reflection (graded)

#### Video submission instructions

Record a short video of yourself explaining your understanding of the Week 1 workflow. Focus on explaining concepts clearly and using correct terminology rather than reading text from the screen.

In your video, address:

-   What feels different from running `.py` scripts in an editor compared to running code in a notebook
-   What the **kernel** is (in your own words)
-   Why “restart the kernel” and “run all” are useful habits
-   One concept from Chapter 1 you can explain accurately

**Requirements**

-   Clear video and audio quality
-   Introduce yourself at the beginning (name)
-   Name your video file: `lastname_Week01Reflection`
-   Upload your video to **Kaltura**
-   **Do not** embed the video in the Dropbox submission
-   Paste the **share link** into the D2L assignment text submission box
-   Make sure the link text includes `lastname_Week01Reflection` in the link name (this will appear if you copy the link)

### D2L submission checklist

Submit the following items to the Week 1 D2L dropboxes.

#### Screenshot files (upload as separate files, not a zip)

1.  `lastname_git-version.png`
2.  `lastname_course-folders.png`
3.  `lastname_book-clone.png`
4.  `lastname_conda-env-list.png`
5.  `lastname_ml-package-versions.png`

#### Video submission (link only)

-   Video filename: `lastname_Week01Reflection`
-   Submit: Paste the share link into the D2L text submission box (do not embed the video in the Dropbox)
