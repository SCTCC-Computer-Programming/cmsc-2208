# Week 8 Assignment Rubric

**Course:** Sp26 CMSC 2208-22 Introduction to Machine Learning

**Total:** / 10

---

## Criterion 1: Video intro + format (/ 1)

| Pass (0.7-1.0) | Needs Improvement (0.1-0.6) | Fail (0.0) |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------|
| Video includes required intro, clear audio, and conversational delivery. | Intro present but incomplete, or audio quality issues that don't prevent understanding. | **Assignment-level fail: YES.** Intro missing, audio unintelligible, or clearly reading a script verbatim. |

---

## Criterion 2: Problem definition (/ 1)

| Pass (0.7-1.0) | Needs Improvement (0.1-0.6) | Fail (0.0) |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------|
| Correctly identifies the task type with clear reasoning; accurately identifies all six features (X) and the target variable (y). | Identifies the task type or features/target but not both, or explanation is vague. | **Assignment-level fail: YES.** Cannot identify the task type, or explanation is fundamentally incorrect. |

---

## Criterion 3: Cost asymmetry reasoning (/ 1)

| Pass (0.7-1.0) | Needs Improvement (0.1-0.6) | Fail (0.0) |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------|
| Explains how the cost imbalance affects decision-making; reasoning is consistent with the cost structure and demonstrates understanding of how unequal error costs affect prediction thresholds. | Restates the costs but does not clearly connect them to how you would use the model's predictions. | Missing, or reasoning contradicts the cost structure described in the assignment. |

---

## Criterion 4: Algorithm recommendation (/ 1)

| Pass (0.7-1.0) | Needs Improvement (0.1-0.6) | Fail (0.0) |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------|
| Recommends a specific algorithm with at least three justifications tied to the data characteristics (mixed feature types, different scales, feature interactions, or interpretability). | Names an algorithm but justification is generic or not connected to the specific data. | **Assignment-level fail: YES.** No recommendation given, or recommends an algorithm with no justification. |

---

## Criterion 5: Complexity parameter + overfitting/underfitting (/ 1)

| Pass (0.7-1.0) | Needs Improvement (0.1-0.6) | Fail (0.0) |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------|
| Correctly names the key complexity parameter for their chosen algorithm, explains what it controls, and describes overfitting and underfitting in the context of predicting machine failures. | Names the parameter but explanation of overfitting/underfitting is generic rather than connected to the scenario. | **Assignment-level fail: YES.** Cannot name the complexity parameter, or fundamentally confuses overfitting with underfitting. |

---

## Criterion 6: Probability estimates method (/ 1)

| Pass (0.7-1.0) | Needs Improvement (0.1-0.6) | Fail (0.0) |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------|
| Correctly names the method; accurately describes its output format for a binary problem; explains why a label alone is not enough for Rivera; gives a concrete example of how the output enables better decisions. | Names the correct method but description of output format is incomplete, or does not explain how Rivera would use it. | **Assignment-level fail: YES.** Cannot name the method, or description of output is fundamentally incorrect. |

---

## Criterion 7: Confidence-based decision-making (/ 1)

| Pass (0.7-1.0) | Needs Improvement (0.1-0.6) | Fail (0.0) |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------|
| Clearly distinguishes how the two machines should be treated differently; reasoning connects to the cost structure for both cases. | Distinguishes the two machines but does not connect to cost structure, or treats both the same. | No comparison attempted, or says both machines should be treated identically. |

---

## Criterion 8: Raw confidence scores method (/ 1)

| Pass (0.7-1.0) | Needs Improvement (0.1-0.6) | Fail (0.0) |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------|
| Correctly names the method; accurately describes how its output differs from probability estimates; identifies when it might be the only option for getting confidence information. | Names the method but description is incomplete or confuses it with probability estimates. | Missing, or fundamentally incorrect. |

---

## Criterion 9: Feature interpretability + limitations (/ 1)

| Pass (0.7-1.0) | Needs Improvement (0.1-0.6) | Fail (0.0) |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------|
| Names the correct interpretability tool for their chosen algorithm; explains what it reveals and identifies a key limitation; names another Chapter 2 algorithm that addresses that limitation. | Mentions interpretability but does not name the specific tool, or does not clearly articulate a limitation. | **Assignment-level fail: YES.** No interpretability discussion, or explanation is fundamentally incorrect. |

---

## Criterion 10: Uncertain machine / capstone synthesis (/ 1)

| Pass (0.7-1.0) | Needs Improvement (0.1-0.6) | Fail (0.0) |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------|
| Makes a clear, justified recommendation; explicitly connects to the cost structure from Section A; demonstrates synthesis of uncertainty and practical decision-making. | Makes a recommendation but does not connect back to cost structure, or reasoning is vague. | **Assignment-level fail: YES.** No recommendation given, or recommendation contradicts the cost structure established in the assignment. |

## Overall Score

| A | B | C | D | F |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 9 points minimum | 8 points minimum | 7 points minimum | 6 points minimum | 0 points minimum |

## Assignment-Level Fail Policy

Criteria marked "Assignment-level fail: YES" represent core competencies for Chapter 2. Receiving a Fail (0.0) on any one of these criteria caps the overall assignment grade at F regardless of total points, and triggers a required resubmission conversation with the instructor.

**Assignment-level fail criteria:** 1 (Video intro + format), 2 (Problem definition), 4 (Algorithm recommendation), 5 (Complexity parameter), 6 (Probability estimates method), 9 (Feature interpretability), 10 (Capstone synthesis)
