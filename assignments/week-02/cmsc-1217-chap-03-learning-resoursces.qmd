## How to use these videos
These are optional “extra help” videos for Week 2.  
Watch them when the reading feels abstract, when you want a second explanation of the same idea, or when you want a deeper (more advanced) take on a topic.  
A good strategy is:  
- Watch one short video first (to get the basic idea)  
- Then come back to the demo and re-run the relevant section  
- If you want more depth, watch one “long-form” talk (PyCon / conference style)

## Exceptions and safe processing (`try/except`)

**Try / Except | Python (Tutorial)**
*by Socratica* — A focused explanation of what `try` and `except` actually do, and why this pattern is useful when you want to keep processing after one failure.

## Parsing: turning one line into fields you can work with


## List comprehensions (compact “build a new list” loops)

**Learn Python LIST COMPREHENSIONS in 10 minutes!**  
*by Bro Code* — Quick overview of list comprehension syntax, comparing them to regular for loops with many clear examples.  
{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/YlY2g2xrl6Q >}}

**List Comprehensions | Python (Tutorial)**
*by Socratica* — A clean “what it is and why it works” explanation, including the mental model for how the loop happens inside the brackets.

## Sorting, ranking, and the `key=` idea


**Python sorted() Function – key Parameter Explained**  
*by Real Python* — Focuses on using the key= argument to sort lists of tuples, objects, and custom data structures.

## Lambda (a small function used inline)

**Learn Python LAMBDA in 6 minutes!**  
*by Bro Code* — Introduces lambda functions as short, anonymous functions and shows common use cases like sorting and mapping.  
{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/IljPHDyBRog >}}

**Python Lambda Functions – Anonymous Functions Explained**  
*by Tech With Tim* — Covers lambda syntax and how they are used inline with sorted(), map(), filter(), and more.

## Generators and iteration (`yield`, streaming one row at a time)

**Python Generators Explained – yield Keyword Tutorial**  
*by Tech With Tim* — Shows what generators are, how yield works, and why they save memory when processing large data.  
{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/bD05uGo_sVI >}}

**Understanding Generators and yield in Python**  
*by Corey Schafer* — Clear explanation of generators, the yield keyword, and converting functions into memory-efficient generators.  
{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/txC9HvAAZx8 >}}

### Optional long-form (advanced, but very good)

**Python Generators: The Final Frontier**  
*by David Beazley (PyCon)* — Deep, advanced exploration of generators, coroutines, and how they power Python’s iteration system.

## Exceptions: handling bad rows without crashing



## List comprehensions (building lists from other sequences)



**Python Tutorial: List Comprehensions**
*by Corey Schafer* — A deeper walkthrough showing common patterns and how comprehensions relate to the equivalent loop form.

## Sorting, ranking, and `key=` with lambda

**Python Tutorial: Lambda Functions**
*by Corey Schafer* — Explains what a `lambda` is, when it’s useful, and how it connects to patterns like `sorted(..., key=...)` and `max(..., key=...)`.

{{< video [https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ob9rY6PQMfI](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ob9rY6PQMfI) >}}

## Generators and streaming (processing one row at a time)

**Python Tutorial: Generators**
*by Corey Schafer* — A practical explanation of `yield`, how generator functions behave differently from normal functions, and what changes when you iterate over a generator.
