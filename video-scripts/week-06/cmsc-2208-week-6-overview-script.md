# Week 6 Overview Video Script

------

Hello everyone, and welcome to Week 6 of Introduction to Machine Learning with Python.

This is an application week. You won't be learning a new algorithm or completing a demo. Instead, you'll work through two case studies that ask you to interpret decision tree results and compare decision trees to the other algorithms you've learned this semester.

## Your Week 6 Tasks

Start by reviewing the key decision tree concepts from Week 5. Make sure you're comfortable with how trees make predictions, what max_depth controls, and how feature importance works. If anything feels unclear, go back to the Week 5 demo before starting the assignment.

The Week 6 assignment has two case studies and a reference scenario. Case Study 1 gives you decision tree results at different max_depth values and asks you to analyze the patterns. Case Study 2 puts kNN, Logistic Regression, and a Decision Tree side by side on the same dataset, with both coefficients and feature importance for you to compare. Scenario C gives you a new problem to reason about, but no model results. Each case study has guiding questions to help you prepare.

Your deliverable is a video reflection. The assignment describes four sections to address in your video. Read through the case studies carefully, think through the guiding questions, and then record your video. Focus on explaining your reasoning clearly, not just stating answers.

## A Few Things to Keep in Mind

Pay attention to what each type of model output can and cannot tell you. The case studies are designed to highlight those differences, and your video should show that you understand them.

Also, don't just compare numbers. The assignment asks you to think about practical trade-offs and when you'd choose one algorithm over another. Use the specific details of each scenario to support your reasoning.

## Wrapping Up

So to summarize: review your Week 5 concepts, work through the case studies in the Week 6 assignment, and record your video reflection addressing all four sections.

Alright, that's it for the Week 6 overview. Good luck with your video reflections.
