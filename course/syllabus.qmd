#### Prerequisites:

CMSC 1203 - Structured Programming Logic

## Course Description

This course introduces data analytics using Python to extract and communicate insights from datasets.

Students acquire foundational skills in data manipulation, including transformation and cleansing, alongside techniques for visualizing data distributions and managing file-based data input/output, preparing them for machine learning applications in subsequent semesters. The course focuses on technical concepts such as trend identification through graphical analysis, data structuring for computational efficiency, and processing real-world datasets for artificial intelligence applications. Through programming exercises and a capstone project analyzing a representative dataset, students develop practical Python programming competencies essential for advanced coursework in machine learning.

### Course Philosophy

This course follows a **tools-first** approach to “data analytics.” Our focus is on the Python programming skills and the data library ecosystem (especially **pandas** and related tools) used to manipulate, process, clean, and summarize real datasets. We will cover analytical concepts only as needed to motivate a tool or technique, but this course is **not** focused on statistical methodology (hypothesis testing, inference, or model theory), which is addressed in other courses.

***This online class requires extensive use of your webcam***

## Course Outcomes

#### Upon completion of this course the student will:

-   Identify fundamental concepts of data analytics and their role in preparing data for machine learning applications.

-   Explain how Python programming streamlines data analysis processes for real-world datasets.

-   Manipulate datasets in Python, including filtering, sorting, and handling missing values.

-   Compare Python data visualization techniques to represent data trends effectively.

-   Assess the quality of a dataset's preparation in Python, identifying areas for improvement in data cleaning and transformation for machine learning readiness.

-   Design a data analytics project in Python to extract insights from a real-world dataset.

## Course Content

1.  Introduction to Data Analytics with Python

2.  Python Libraries for Data Manipulation (Pandas)

3.  Data Cleaning and Preparation in Python

4.  Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

Webcam Required

***\*\*\* STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE THEIR MATERIALS AT THE START OF THE COURSE\*\*\****

## Methods of Instruction

Student Presentation Problem Solving Internet

Creative Projects Assigned Reading

Project Critiques Labs Lecture

Film/Slides/Videos Demonstrations

## Grading/Evaluation

Tests, textbook problems, individual projects, video assignments, and performance will be graded. Grades will be updated in D2L and you are responsible for verifying that your grades are correct. Academic Progress reports will only be sent out to students earning a grade of a “D” or lower. Course Grades will be per the following criteria:

A = 100 – 90%

B = 89 – 80%

C = 79 – 70%

D = 69 – 60 %

F = Below 60 %

Grades are weighted as follows:

-   Labs - 45%
-   Video Activities – 40%
-   D2L Quizzes/Tests – 15%

Some assignments will be based off a pass/fail criterion. Grading Rubrics will be assigned to most course activities. Some assignments are automatically graded. Activities may be assigned but not be graded, these are for self-review to prepare you for graded activities. ‘Proof’ files will be provided to you on occasion to help you identify any issues with your assignment. It is expected that you review these when you receive your rubric feedback. Extra credit assignments or additional assignments are not offered in this course.
