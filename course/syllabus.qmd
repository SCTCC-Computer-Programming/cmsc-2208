#### Prerequisites:

- CMSC 1203 - Structured Programming Logic (Minimum grade: 1.67 GPA Equivalent)
- CMSC 1236 - Advanced Python Programming (Minimum grade: 1.67 GPA Equivalent)
- CMSC 1217 - Introduction to Data Analytics (Minimum grade: 1.67 GPA Equivalent)

## Course Description

This course introduces students to the fundamentals of machine learning using Python, equipping them with practical, hands-on skills that build on foundational data analytics and advanced programming proficiencies from CMSC1217 and CMSC1236. Students will explore key concepts including supervised and unsupervised learning, data preparation, model training, evaluation, and project structuring. Emphasizing a programming-focused approach, the course enables learners to create simple machine learning tools, ultimately preparing them for advanced technical roles and enhancing their employability in an AI-driven tech industry. By the end of the course, students will be able to design, implement, and evaluate basic machine learning models for real-world problem solving.

## Course Outcomes

#### Upon completion of this course the student will:

- Describe the fundamental programming-based concepts of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, and their practical programming applications using Python.
- Explain how programming tools automate and enhance machine learning processes for real- world datasets.
- Use Python to implement basic supervised learning models, such as linear regression or classification, on simple datasets.
- Compare different programming-based evaluation metrics to assess model performance effectively for machine learning tasks.
- Assess the effectiveness of data preparation techniques using Python for improving machine learning model outcomes.
- Develop a machine learning project using Python, integrating data preparation, a basic model, programming-based evaluation, and project structuring.

Webcam Required

***\*\*\* STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE THEIR MATERIALS AT THE START OF THE COURSE\*\*\****

## Methods of Instruction

Student Presentation Problem Solving Internet

Creative Projects Assigned Reading

## Grading/Evaluation

Tests, textbook problems, individual projects, video assignments, and performance will be graded. Grades will be updated in D2L and you are responsible for verifying that your grades are correct. Academic Progress reports will only be sent out to students earning a grade of a “D” or lower. Course Grades will be per the following criteria:

A = 100 – 90%

B = 89 – 80%

C = 79 – 70%

D = 69 – 60 %

F = Below 60 %

Grades are weighted as follows:

-   Labs and Video Activities - 50%
-   Final Projects – 20%
-   D2L Quizzes/Tests – 30%

Some assignments will be based off a pass/fail criterion. Grading Rubrics will be assigned to most course activities. Some assignments are automatically graded. Activities may be assigned but not be graded, these are for self-review to prepare you for graded activities. ‘Proof’ files will be provided to you on occasion to help you identify any issues with your assignment. It is expected that you review these when you receive your rubric feedback. Extra credit assignments or additional assignments are not offered in this course.
