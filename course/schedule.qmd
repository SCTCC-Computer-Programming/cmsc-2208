## Final project (Apr 27–May 11)

**Deliverable (May 11, 2026):** a single notebook-based report that demonstrates an end-to-end workflow.


Minimum components:

- Load one real dataset (CSV/JSON/Excel)

- Cleaning + preparation steps (with brief justification)

- Wrangling/aggregation (at least one `merge` or `groupby` style task)

- **2–4** clear visualizations with labels

- Short written narrative: what you did, what you found, limitations/next steps

- Export at least one output artifact (cleaned CSV and/or saved figures)
