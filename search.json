The chapter uses examples such as spam filtering and face detection to show why rule-based approaches can break down, and how learning from data can be a practical alternative.\nTwo ideas are introduced early:\n\nMachine learning methods automate decision-making by generalizing from known examples, rather than relying on a fixed set of hand-built rules.\nThe quality of what a model can learn depends on what information is actually present in the dataset, especially in the features used to describe each example.\n\nFor that reason, Chapter 1 spends time defining how data is described in machine learning. It introduces the “table” framing (samples as rows and features as columns), names the key terms sample and feature, and emphasizes that no algorithm can make predictions using information that is not represented in the features.",

    "title": "Using AI as a Learning Tool",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Purpose of this policy\nTools that use artificial intelligence are now widely available, and many of you already use them when learning technical material. This course allows the use of AI tools as a learning aid, similar to a tutor or reference source. At the same time, this course requires that submitted work reflect your own understanding and decision-making.\nThis page explains how AI tools may be used productively in this course, and where their use becomes inappropriate.\n\n\nAI as a learning tool\nUsing AI as a learning tool means using it to clarify ideas, terminology, or examples that you do not yet understand.\n\nIdeas An idea is a concept or principle discussed in the course materials, such as how a process works, why a particular approach is used, or what a tool is designed to do. Clarifying an idea means using AI to help you understand the purpose or reasoning behind something you have already encountered in class, rather than asking for a final answer.\nTerminology Terminology refers to the specific words and phrases used in technical subjects. These terms often have precise meanings that differ from everyday usage. Using AI appropriately includes asking for explanations of unfamiliar terms so you can understand how they are used in context, especially when reading textbooks, documentation, or assignment instructions.\nExamples Examples are demonstrations that show how an idea or concept is applied in practice. Using AI to clarify examples means asking for help understanding why an example works, what each part is doing, or how it relates to the underlying concept. It does not mean copying an example and submitting it as your own work.\n\nIn all cases, using AI as a learning tool should help you build understanding, not replace the effort of reading, experimenting, or reasoning through a problem yourself.\n\n\nAI as a crutch\nAI tools can support learning, but they can also be used in ways that reduce learning. This policy uses the term “crutch” to describe situations where the tool is doing the thinking and decision-making that the student is expected to practice.\nUsing AI as a crutch means relying on it to produce work or reasoning that you do not understand well enough to explain and defend. The issue is not that the tool was used; the issue is that the tool replaced the learning process.\nInappropriate uses include:\n\nAsking AI to complete an assignment or lab task for you Example: “Write the solution for this assignment.”\nSubmitting AI-generated code, answers, or explanations that you cannot explain in your own words Example: Copying an explanation of why a solution works without being able to describe the steps yourself.\nTreating AI output as authoritative without verification Example: Accepting an answer that conflicts with course materials, documentation, or results you can reproduce.\nUsing AI to bypass the learning objective Example: Asking for the final answer when the point of the activity is to practice reasoning, debugging, designing, or interpreting results.\nUsing AI to write or script reflections that are meant to describe your own understanding Example: Asking AI to generate a script or talking points for a reflection video instead of explaining the ideas in your own words.\n\nIn these cases, AI is being used to avoid the intended learning work rather than to support it.\n\n\nWhy this matters\nAI can produce output that appears correct even when it contains errors or is based on incorrect assumptions. Because of that, it is important to treat AI output as a starting point for learning, not as an authority.\nThis course emphasizes:\n\nverifying results,\nunderstanding workflows,\nand explaining decisions clearly.\n\nIf you rely on AI answers without testing them or understanding them, you are likely to miss errors and build misunderstandings. Those gaps tend to surface later in the course when tasks require independent problem solving, accurate interpretation, and clear explanations in graded work.\n\n\nExpectations for submitted work\nAll submitted work must reflect your own understanding.\nThis means:\n\nYou should be able to explain any code you submit.\nYou should be able to describe why you made particular choices (model, metric, preprocessing).\nIn reflections, your explanations should sound like you, not like a generic answer generator.\n\nYou are not required to disclose routine AI use for clarification or studying. However, if your work suggests that you do not understand what you submitted, that will be treated the same way as any other lack of understanding, regardless of the source.\nIf you use an AI tool, ask yourself:\n\nCould I explain this answer to another student without looking it up?\nDid I test or verify what the tool suggested?\nDid the tool help me understand, or did it just give me something to submit?\n\nIf the tool helped you understand, you are using it appropriately. If it replaced your thinking, you are not.",

    "section": "Course Policies/Practices",
    "text": "Course Policies/Practices\n\nAcademic Integrity\nAcademic integrity is highly valued at St. Cloud Technical & Community College and throughout higher education. Maintaining academic integrity is the responsibility of every member of the college community: faculty, staff, administrators and students. Academic integrity requires students to refrain from engaging in or tolerating acts including, but not limited to, submitting false academic records, cheating, plagiarizing, altering, forging, or misusing a college academic record; acquiring or using test materials without faculty permission; acting alone or in cooperation with another to falsify records or to obtain dishonest grades, honors, or awards.\nAny violation of the St. Cloud Technical & Community College’s Academic Integrity Policy S3.28 is considered a disciplinary offense and will be subject to the policies of this instructor, entrance into the Academic Integrity Database, and possible disciplinary action as outlined in the Academic Integrity Procedure S3.28.1. Students accused of academic dishonesty may appeal the decision. Students may review the Academic Integrity process and access the Academic Integrity Appeal Form at https://www.sctcc.edu/academic-integrity.\nClass policy for Academic Integrity Violations will result in a reduction of your grade.\nhttp://sctcc.edu/sites/default/files/policies/S3.24%20Complaint%20Grievance.pdf\n\n\nClassroom Behavior\nAttendance is a necessary part of this course. Refer to the attendance policy outlined later in the syllabus\nOnline discussions should be civilized and respectful to everyone and relevant to the topic we are discussing.\nDisruptive behavior on any communication platform will not be tolerated.\nYou are expected to do your own work unless otherwise directed. Cheating, plagiarism, and any other form of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please refer to the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity policy for details.\nAny indication of inebriation or being under the influence, and/or displaying of alcohol or use of paraphernalia that could be associated with drug usage during assignments/course activities will result in removal from the session and/or course. No smoking during any online sessions. My policy is to remove you from the course and leave it to you to file a grievance to return.\nMeaningful and constructive dialogue is encouraged, but this also requires a degree of mutual respect, willingness to listen, and tolerance of opposing points of view. Respect for individual differences and alternative viewpoints will always be expected in this course. One’s words and use of language should be temperate and within acceptable bounds of civility and decency.\nDisruptive behaviors, including excessive talking about off topic items, arriving late to the start of meetings or returning late from breaks, sleeping, reading, or watching media, or game playing is not permitted and will result in a grade penalty.\nExtreme disruptive behavior, fighting (verbally), using repetitive profanity, personal or physical threats or insults, and angry outbursts, will result in your removal from the course in accordance with policies and procedures outlined in the SCTCC’s Code of Student Conduct.\nIf a student’s disruptive behavior causes them to miss an assignment, they will not receive credit for that assignment. If a student has been sanctioned due to disruptive behavior, they waive the right to a warning on a second occurrence.\n\n\nData Privacy and Student Course Progress\nStudents are encouraged to take ownership over their academic progress and communicate with faculty directly for any questions or concerns regarding their coursework. I am reachable at my listed contact information and office hours on this syllabus and happy to discuss your progress with you.\nPer the College’s Student Data Practices policy, I am unable to share information about a student’s course progress to anyone other than the student, including third parties such as parents/guardians, unless a current Information Release is on file with the Records and Registration Office. Faculty are often unable to confirm if an Information Release is on file, so it is always preferred that the student speak with the faculty one-on-one.\nBecause of the items outlined above, should a third party contact me directly with a question or concern about your progress, I will defer my response to you and not the third party. Students shall also not invite third parties to attend class meetings (online), as this causes a disruption to the learning environment.\nIf a student would like their course progress information released to a third party, they may do so by contacting the Dean’s office to make a request for specific information to be shared with the third party.\n\n\nComputer Requirements\nA Computer meeting the program requirements and able to run multiple instances of Windows or Linux OS concurrently (using virtualization) is required for this class.\nComputer requirements are outlined here:\nhttps://www.sctcc.edu/degrees-programs/computer-programming\n\n\nD2L\nA fundamental understanding of D2L is required for this course as it is the primary method to communicate course schedules, grade information, and class news. It is the student’s responsibility to learn to navigate and find information on D2L. SCTCC does offer information sessions on this tool.\n\n\nAttendance/Participation:\nAttendance is expected and monitored. You are responsible for monitoring your attendance and your absence count.\nAttendance will be determined by up to two contributing factors, logging into your D2L Brightspace course, and submission of weekly assignments. Failure to log into class and/or submit assignments for a week will result in an absence. Failure to log into class during a week where an assignment is not due and is not a scheduled holiday/spring break week will result in an absence. I will check logins and assignment submission for the previous week every Monday.\nYou must log into your online class and complete an activity by 11:30 PM on the first Wednesday of the first week of class. Failure to log in will result in being dropped from the course.\nMissing two consecutive weeks of class will result in being dropped from the course.\nMissing two total weeks of class (non-consecutive and any combination of unexcused/excused) will result in a reduction of one letter grade (10% of total points). Missing three total weeks of class will result in an additional reduction of a letter grade. Any absence over three will result in a further reduction of a letter grade for each occurrence. Classes I teach are considered independent of each other with respect to attendance. You may meet attendance requirements in one of my classes but fail attendance requirements in another class.\n\n\nTesting:\nD2L tests are electronic quizzes. These may be scheduled ahead of time or given without warning. If a D2L test is password protected, sharing passwords with another student will constitute an integrity violation.\nTests are not restricted to a specific day for this course but must be completed by the assignment due date as scheduled. You may have multiple attempts at an Online D2L quiz. Time for each question is normally 45 seconds per question. If multiple attempts are allowed, you must score greater than 60% on your first attempt to be allowed a second attempt and you must score greater than an 80% on your second attempt to be allowed a third attempt (if there is a third attempt). If you exceed the time limit on the quiz, the grading engine will mark the test as a 0 and will not allow any further work on your quiz. Always be aware of the time remaining on your quiz. You may not leave a quiz once you start it.\nNote on auto generated D2L Tests: You may not be able to backtrack through the questions on a D2L quiz. The Next Page and Submit Button are close to each other on the test page. It is possible to Submit a quiz inadvertently if you are not paying attention so ensure that you are reading the popup messages.\nTests and quizzes cannot be made up.\n\n\nSchedule\nSubject to change based on instructor and class needs.\n\n\nAssignments/Projects\nAll assignments must be turned in by the due date. Due dates will be announced during class and posted on D2L . Late assignments will not be accepted. A late assignment is any assignment that is not in the dropbox by the due/end date. Sometimes assignments will consist of two parts, a video submission, and a file submission. Missing either portion of the assignment will make the assignment ineligible for grading. Video assignments that cannot be accessed by the instructor at the time of grading will also not be accepted. All projects and assignments should be archived and kept. Any group work assigned is also ineligible for makeup so make sure that you are a responsible, considerate groupmate.\nTypes of assignments you may encounter in this course:\nWeekly practice assignments – are based on the week’s topics. You will normally receive 5 – 7 days to complete these types of assignment.\nProjects – are longer assignments that are bigger in scope than a practice assignment and usually have a timeline with concrete checkpoints. These assignments may be done in a group setting or individually depending on the project.\nVideo Assignments – are assignments in which you will use your webcam and record your desktop to complete a specific activity. Some video assignments are group-based activities. Ensure that you review the assignment and the assignment rubric for specific instructions.\n\n\nDress\nStudents are expected to dress in a manner that is considerate of their classmates and the instructor for any online video assignments.",

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nIn these courses, you will work inside a conda environment. An environment is an isolated Python installation (Python + packages) stored in a folder on your computer. This helps everyone use consistent tools and reduces setup conflicts.\nYou will use the following tools:\n\nMiniconda Miniconda is a small installer that provides Conda, a system for managing Python installations and packages. Miniconda does not include many data-science packages by default; instead, it gives you a controlled way to install exactly what a course requires.\nConda (the environment manager) Conda is software that can create, activate, and manage environments. It can also install packages (libraries) in a way that keeps them consistent and reduces compatibility problems, especially for scientific packages.\nConda environment A conda environment is a self-contained folder that contains:\n\na specific version of Python, and\na specific set of installed packages. Each environment is separate from other environments on your computer. This means one course can use one set of packages (and versions) without affecting another course or your personal Python installation.\n\nJupyterLab (notebook workspace) JupyterLab is a browser-based programming environment used for data analysis and machine learning. It allows you to write code in cells, run those cells, and view output (tables, plots, printed results) directly below the code. JupyterLab is used in both courses because it supports step-by-step work and makes it easier to review results.\nIPython (interactive Python terminal — CMSC-1217 only) IPython is an enhanced interactive Python terminal. It provides features that support exploratory work, such as command history, tab completion, and built-in help. In CMSC-1217, IPython is used to practice interactive exploration and reinforce core Python concepts in a terminal-based workflow.\n\nHow these pieces fit together\nMiniconda installs Conda, and Conda is the tool you use to create a course environment. When you activate that environment, your terminal temporarily switches so that the python command (and tools like jupyter) run from the environment’s folder. You then start Jupyter (JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook), and the notebook runs Python from the active environment, using the packages installed there. This sequence—install Miniconda → create environment → activate environment → start Jupyter → run notebooks—is the standard workflow you will use throughout the course.\n\nImportant: During Miniconda installation, do not add Miniconda to PATH. We will use the Miniconda/Anaconda Prompt when working for these courses.",

    "text": "1) Install Miniconda\n\nDownload and install Miniconda (64-bit) for Windows. https://www.anaconda.com/download\nDuring installation, do not add Miniconda to PATH.\n\nWhy not add to PATH: Many of you already have a Python installation from python.org. Not adding Miniconda to PATH prevents Miniconda from changing which python runs in non-course terminals.\nMiniconda is a lightweight installer that provides:\n\nConda (a package and environment manager), and\na basic Python installation and its dependencies.\n\nMiniconda is intentionally minimal: it does not install a large collection of data-science packages by default. Instead, you install only the packages required for the course.\nRelationship to Anaconda\nMiniconda and Anaconda are closely related:\n\nAnaconda Distribution is a larger installer that comes with hundreds of packages pre-installed, plus optional tools like Anaconda Navigator.\nMiniconda is a smaller installer that includes only conda, Python, and a small core set of packages, and then you add what you need.\n\nFor these courses, Miniconda is a good fit because it helps us keep your course environment clean, consistent, and easier to troubleshoot.\nWhy Miniconda/Conda is common in data analysis and machine learning\nData analysis and machine learning often rely on libraries that include compiled components. Conda is widely used in these areas because it can install many scientific packages as prebuilt binaries, which reduces installation difficulties (especially on Windows).\nConda also supports creating separate environments so different projects can use different versions of Python/packages without interfering with each other.",

A channel is a repository that hosts packaged software (similar in purpose to an “app store,” but for programming libraries). When you install a package with conda, conda searches the configured channels to find a compatible version of that package and its dependencies.\nWe use conda-forge because it is a widely used community-maintained channel that provides current, well-tested builds of many scientific and data-analysis libraries (for example, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn). Using a consistent channel helps ensure that most students receive the same package builds and reduces platform-specific installation problems.\nSetting strict channel priority means conda will prefer packages from the highest-priority channel (in this case, conda-forge) rather than mixing packages from multiple channels. This matters because mixing package sources can sometimes lead to version conflicts or dependency mismatches. Strict priority reduces those problems by keeping package selection consistent.",
