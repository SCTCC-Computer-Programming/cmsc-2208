The course focuses on technical concepts such as trend identification through graphical analysis, data structuring for computational efficiency, and processing real-world datasets for artificial intelligence applications. Through programming exercises and a capstone project analyzing a representative dataset, students develop practical Python programming competencies essential for advanced coursework in machine learning.\n\nCourse Philosophy\nThis course follows a tools-first approach to “data analytics.” Our focus is on the Python programming skills and the data library ecosystem (especially pandas and related tools) used to manipulate, process, clean, and summarize real datasets. We will cover analytical concepts only as needed to motivate a tool or technique, but this course is not focused on statistical methodology (hypothesis testing, inference, or model theory), which is addressed in other courses.\nThis online class requires extensive use of your webcam",

    "section": "Course Policies/Practices",
    "text": "Course Policies/Practices\n\nAcademic Integrity\nAcademic integrity is highly valued at St. Cloud Technical & Community College and throughout higher education. Maintaining academic integrity is the responsibility of every member of the college community: faculty, staff, administrators and students. Academic integrity requires students to refrain from engaging in or tolerating acts including, but not limited to, submitting false academic records, cheating, plagiarizing, altering, forging, or misusing a college academic record; acquiring or using test materials without faculty permission; acting alone or in cooperation with another to falsify records or to obtain dishonest grades, honors, or awards.\nAny violation of the St. Cloud Technical & Community College’s Academic Integrity Policy S3.28 is considered a disciplinary offense and will be subject to the policies of this instructor, entrance into the Academic Integrity Database, and possible disciplinary action as outlined in the Academic Integrity Procedure S3.28.1. Students accused of academic dishonesty may appeal the decision. Students may review the Academic Integrity process and access the Academic Integrity Appeal Form at https://www.sctcc.edu/academic-integrity.\nClass policy for Academic Integrity Violations will result in a reduction of your grade.\nhttp://sctcc.edu/sites/default/files/policies/S3.24%20Complaint%20Grievance.pdf\n\n\nClassroom Behavior\nAttendance is a necessary part of this course. Refer to the attendance policy outlined later in the syllabus\nOnline discussions should be civilized and respectful to everyone and relevant to the topic we are discussing.\nDisruptive behavior on any communication platform will not be tolerated.\nYou are expected to do your own work unless otherwise directed. Cheating, plagiarism, and any other form of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please refer to the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity policy for details.\nAny indication of inebriation or being under the influence, and/or displaying of alcohol or use of paraphernalia that could be associated with drug usage during assignments/course activities will result in removal from the session and/or course. No smoking during any online sessions. My policy is to remove you from the course and leave it to you to file a grievance to return.\nMeaningful and constructive dialogue is encouraged, but this also requires a degree of mutual respect, willingness to listen, and tolerance of opposing points of view. Respect for individual differences and alternative viewpoints will always be expected in this course. One’s words and use of language should be temperate and within acceptable bounds of civility and decency.\nDisruptive behaviors, including excessive talking about off topic items, arriving late to the start of meetings or returning late from breaks, sleeping, reading, or watching media, or game playing is not permitted and will result in a grade penalty.\nExtreme disruptive behavior, fighting (verbally), using repetitive profanity, personal or physical threats or insults, and angry outbursts, will result in your removal from the course in accordance with policies and procedures outlined in the SCTCC’s Code of Student Conduct.\nIf a student’s disruptive behavior causes them to miss an assignment, they will not receive credit for that assignment. If a student has been sanctioned due to disruptive behavior, they waive the right to a warning on a second occurrence.\n\n\nData Privacy and Student Course Progress\nStudents are encouraged to take ownership over their academic progress and communicate with faculty directly for any questions or concerns regarding their coursework. I am reachable at my listed contact information and office hours on this syllabus and happy to discuss your progress with you.\nPer the College’s Student Data Practices policy, I am unable to share information about a student’s course progress to anyone other than the student, including third parties such as parents/guardians, unless a current Information Release is on file with the Records and Registration Office. Faculty are often unable to confirm if an Information Release is on file, so it is always preferred that the student speak with the faculty one-on-one.\nBecause of the items outlined above, should a third party contact me directly with a question or concern about your progress, I will defer my response to you and not the third party. Students shall also not invite third parties to attend class meetings (online), as this causes a disruption to the learning environment.\nIf a student would like their course progress information released to a third party, they may do so by contacting the Dean’s office to make a request for specific information to be shared with the third party.\n\n\nComputer Requirements\nA Computer meeting the program requirements and able to run multiple instances of Windows or Linux OS concurrently (using virtualization) is required for this class.\nComputer requirements are outlined here:\nhttps://www.sctcc.edu/degrees-programs/computer-programming\n\n\nD2L\nA fundamental understanding of D2L is required for this course as it is the primary method to communicate course schedules, grade information, and class news. It is the student’s responsibility to learn to navigate and find information on D2L. SCTCC does offer information sessions on this tool.\n\n\nAttendance/Participation:\nAttendance is expected and monitored. You are responsible for monitoring your attendance and your absence count.\nAttendance will be determined by up to two contributing factors, logging into your D2L Brightspace course, and submission of weekly assignments. Failure to log into class and/or submit assignments for a week will result in an absence. Failure to log into class during a week where an assignment is not due and is not a scheduled holiday/spring break week will result in an absence. I will check logins and assignment submission for the previous week every Monday.\nYou must log into your online class and complete an activity by 11:30 PM on the first Wednesday of the first week of class. Failure to log in will result in being dropped from the course.\nMissing two consecutive weeks of class will result in being dropped from the course.\nMissing two total weeks of class (non-consecutive and any combination of unexcused/excused) will result in a reduction of one letter grade (10% of total points). Missing three total weeks of class will result in an additional reduction of a letter grade. Any absence over three will result in a further reduction of a letter grade for each occurrence. Classes I teach are considered independent of each other with respect to attendance. You may meet attendance requirements in one of my classes but fail attendance requirements in another class.\n\n\nTesting:\nD2L tests are electronic quizzes. These may be scheduled ahead of time or given without warning. If a D2L test is password protected, sharing passwords with another student will constitute an integrity violation.\nTests are not restricted to a specific day for this course but must be completed by the assignment due date as scheduled. You may have multiple attempts at an Online D2L quiz. Time for each question is normally 45 seconds per question. If multiple attempts are allowed, you must score greater than 60% on your first attempt to be allowed a second attempt and you must score greater than an 80% on your second attempt to be allowed a third attempt (if there is a third attempt). If you exceed the time limit on the quiz, the grading engine will mark the test as a 0 and will not allow any further work on your quiz. Always be aware of the time remaining on your quiz. You may not leave a quiz once you start it.\nNote on auto generated D2L Tests: You may not be able to backtrack through the questions on a D2L quiz. The Next Page and Submit Button are close to each other on the test page. It is possible to Submit a quiz inadvertently if you are not paying attention so ensure that you are reading the popup messages.\nTests and quizzes cannot be made up.\n\n\nSchedule\nSubject to change based on instructor and class needs.\n\n\nAssignments/Projects\nAll assignments must be turned in by the due date. Due dates will be announced during class and posted on D2L . Late assignments will not be accepted. A late assignment is any assignment that is not in the dropbox by the due/end date. Sometimes assignments will consist of two parts, a video submission, and a file submission. Missing either portion of the assignment will make the assignment ineligible for grading. Video assignments that cannot be accessed by the instructor at the time of grading will also not be accepted. All projects and assignments should be archived and kept. Any group work assigned is also ineligible for makeup so make sure that you are a responsible, considerate groupmate.\nTypes of assignments you may encounter in this course:\nWeekly practice assignments – are based on the week’s topics. You will normally receive 5 – 7 days to complete these types of assignment.\nProjects – are longer assignments that are bigger in scope than a practice assignment and usually have a timeline with concrete checkpoints. These assignments may be done in a group setting or individually depending on the project.\nVideo Assignments – are assignments in which you will use your webcam and record your desktop to complete a specific activity. Some video assignments are group-based activities. Ensure that you review the assignment and the assignment rubric for specific instructions.\n\n\nDress\nStudents are expected to dress in a manner that is considerate of their classmates and the instructor for any online video assignments.",

    "text": "You are coming into this course with Python experience from Structured Programming Logic. That course focused on writing and running Python programs in a more traditional editor-and-console workflow.\nIn this course, you will still write Python, but the workspace will look different. We will use Jupyter notebooks as the main place to practice and show your work. A notebook combines explanation text, code, and output in one document, which makes it easier to follow examples, retry steps, and keep your work organized.\nWeek 1 is where you learn that workflow and get your course setup working. You will also be introduced to the tool ecosystem used throughout the textbook: pandas and NumPy for working with data, and matplotlib for basic plotting. Chapter 1 introduces this ecosystem and why it exists. Chapter 2 introduces notebooks and the interactive workflow.\nThis week is also a chance to get comfortable navigating the textbook and looking up unfamiliar terms. Do not be a passive learner. In an AI-driven environment, it is easy to copy an answer without understanding it, and it is also easy to get a confident answer that is wrong. Your job is to read, test, and confirm.\nSection 1.6 in the textbook is especially useful this week.

    "text": "You are coming into this course with Python experience from Structured Programming Logic. That course focused on writing and running Python programs in a more traditional editor-and-console workflow.\nIn this course, you will still write Python, but the workspace will look different. We will use Jupyter notebooks as the main place to practice and show your work. A notebook combines explanation text, code, and output in one document, which makes it easier to follow examples, retry steps, and keep your work organized.\nWeek 1 is where you learn that workflow and get your course setup working. You will also be introduced to the tool ecosystem used throughout the textbook: pandas and NumPy for working with data, and matplotlib for basic plotting. Chapter 1 introduces this ecosystem and why it exists. Chapter 2 introduces notebooks and the interactive workflow.\nThis week is also a chance to get comfortable navigating the textbook and looking up unfamiliar terms. Do not be a passive learner.

You will learn how to load data, inspect it, clean it, reshape it, summarize it, and visualize it. The emphasis is on building practical skill with the core libraries and the day-to-day workflow used in data work.\nThis course is not a statistics class. We are not spending the semester on statistical theory, inference, or formal methodology. When we use analytical ideas, it will be to support a tool we are learning and to help you interpret what your code produced. Think of this course as learning how to do the work in Python; your statistics elective covers more of the theory behind the methods.",

    "text": "Jupyter notebooks\nIn Structured Programming Logic, you typically wrote Python in a file and ran the whole program from start to finish. Each run started fresh.\nA Jupyter notebook is different. A notebook is a single document that mixes:\n\ntext (explanations and notes)\ncode (Python)\noutput (tables, printed results, charts)\n\nInstead of running one program from top to bottom every time, a notebook is built from cells. You run the notebook one cell at a time, in the order you choose.\nThis is powerful for learning and working with data because you can try something, see the result immediately, adjust it, and continue. The textbook discusses this interactive workflow and how notebooks fit into it.\nThe most important new idea is that the notebook runs in a live Python session. That session keeps everything you have already created (variables, imported libraries, data you loaded). If you run cells out of order, you can end up in a confusing state where your notebook depends on something you ran earlier but forgot to rerun.\nBecause of that, this course uses one consistent habit:\nRestart Kernel and Run All\nThat is how you confirm your notebook works from a clean start and in the correct order.\nNotebooks are a great learning tool, but they can also make it easy to skip real understanding. If you only change a few lines and press run, you can end up with working output without knowing why it works. Your goal in this class is not just to produce output, but to understand what your code is doing. When you use examples from the book, from a class notebook, or from AI, your job is to test small changes and confirm you still understand the result.\nUsing notebooks does not mean you are not writing code. You will still write Python in this course, but you will write it in smaller pieces and run it as you go. Many examples in the book are meant to be typed, run, and modified so you can see how changes affect the result. Chapter 2 discusses this interactive workflow and how to work effectively in notebooks.",
